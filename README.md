# SynapSeq Hub

**The official repository of sequences, presets, and soundscapes for
[SynapSeq](https://github.com/ruanklein/synapseq).**

SynapSeq Hub is the curated archive for official and community-created
`.spsq` sequences, structured compositions designed to guide
brainwave states for relaxation, focus, meditation, and creative
exploration.

All sequences hosted here are written using the [SynapSeq text syntax](https://github.com/ruanklein/synapseq/blob/main/docs/USAGE.md),
ensuring full compatibility and reproducibility.

---

## Purpose

The goal of SynapSeq Hub is to provide an open, validated, and
self-consistent collection of creative works built with SynapSeq.

It allows users to share, discover, and learn from each other's
compositions, ensuring both technical integrity and artistic freedom.
