## WAVEFORM DEMONSTRATION SEQUENCE
## This sample demonstrates the four main waveform types available in SynapSeq
## using isochronic tones at 250Hz carrier with 8Hz entrainment frequency.
##
## AVAILABLE WAVEFORMS:
## SynapSeq supports four fundamental waveform types that can be applied to
## various entrainment methods, each with distinct sonic characteristics and
## therapeutic applications.
##
## 1. SINE WAVE (Default):
## - Pure, smooth, fundamental frequency without harmonics
## - Most natural and gentle sound, easiest on the ears
## - Ideal for: Relaxation, meditation, sleep induction, sensitive users
## - Best for: Long sessions, high amplitudes, general therapeutic use
## - Characteristics: Clean, soft, non-fatiguing, mathematically pure
##
## 2. SQUARE WAVE:
## - Sharp on/off transitions creating rich harmonic content
## - Contains odd harmonics (3rd, 5th, 7th, etc.) at decreasing amplitudes
## - More intense and penetrating than sine waves
## - Ideal for: Focus enhancement, alertness, cognitive stimulation
## - CAUTION: Use lower amplitudes (<10) - can be harsh at high volumes
## - Characteristics: Sharp, digital-like, attention-grabbing, potentially fatiguing
##
## 3. TRIANGLE WAVE:
## - Gradual rise and fall creating softer harmonic content than square
## - Contains odd harmonics but at much lower amplitudes than square
## - Balanced between sine smoothness and square intensity
## - Ideal for: Balanced entrainment, creative work, moderate stimulation
## - Characteristics: Warm, musical, less harsh than square, more complex than sine
##
## 4. SAWTOOTH WAVE:
## - Linear rise with sharp drop, creating rich harmonic spectrum
## - Contains both odd and even harmonics at decreasing amplitudes
## - Most complex harmonic content of all waveforms
## - Ideal for: Deep entrainment, complex brainwave patterns, advanced users
## - Characteristics: Bright, buzzy, harmonically rich, can be intense
##
## WAVEFORM COMPATIBILITY:
## All waveforms can be used with:
## - TONE METHODS: binaural, monaural, isochronic
## - SPIN EFFECTS: brown noise spin, pink noise spin, white noise spin
## - EFFECT TYPES: spin effects, pulse effects
##
## USAGE GUIDELINES BY CONTEXT:
##
## RELAXATION & SLEEP:
## - Primary: Sine wave (gentle, non-stimulating)
## - Alternative: Triangle wave (warm, musical)
## - Avoid: Square and sawtooth (too stimulating)
##
## FOCUS & CONCENTRATION:
## - Primary: Square wave (alerting, cognitive stimulation)
## - Alternative: Sawtooth wave (complex, engaging)
## - Moderate: Triangle wave (balanced stimulation)
##
## MEDITATION & MINDFULNESS:
## - Primary: Sine wave (pure, non-distracting)
## - Alternative: Triangle wave (harmonious, balanced)
## - Advanced: Sawtooth wave (complex, deep states)
##
## CREATIVE WORK:
## - Primary: Triangle wave (inspiring, balanced)
## - Alternative: Sawtooth wave (complex, innovative thinking)
## - Support: Sine wave (background, non-intrusive)
##
## THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS:
## - Anxiety/Stress: Sine wave (calming, gentle)
## - ADHD/Focus: Square wave (alerting, structured)
## - Depression: Triangle wave (uplifting, warm)
## - Insomnia: Sine wave (soothing, sleep-inducing)
##
## AMPLITUDE RECOMMENDATIONS:
## - Sine Wave: 15-20 (can handle higher amplitudes)
## - Triangle Wave: 12-18 (moderate amplitudes)
## - Square Wave: 5-10 (IMPORTANT: keep lower to avoid harshness)
## - Sawtooth Wave: 10-15 (moderate to avoid fatigue)
##
## TEMPORAL SEQUENCE BREAKDOWN:
## 00:00-00:15: Initial silence
## 00:15-00:30: SINE WAVE - pure 250Hz with 8Hz isochronic pulsing
## 00:30-00:45: SQUARE WAVE - sharp 250Hz with harmonic content (lower amplitude)
## 00:45-01:00: TRIANGLE WAVE - warm 250Hz with moderate harmonic complexity
## 01:00-01:15: SAWTOOTH WAVE - bright 250Hz with full harmonic spectrum
## 01:15+: End of sequence
##
## LISTENING TIPS:
## - Start with sine wave to establish baseline comfort
## - Notice the harmonic richness progression from sine to sawtooth
## - Pay attention to how each waveform affects your mental state differently
## - Square wave demonstrates why amplitude control is crucial
## - Use this sequence to determine your preferred waveform for different activities
## - Each waveform creates different subjective experiences despite same frequencies
